This program serves as a shortcut to execute `iw4x.exe` with the `-zonebuilder` parameter, including any additional arguments provided. Its purpose is to enhance the discoverability and usability of ZoneBuilder, which is directly integrated into the [IW4x Client](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `zonebuilder.exe` requires MW2 and IW4x to be installed and is included in the releases of [IW4x Rawfiles](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-rawfiles).
